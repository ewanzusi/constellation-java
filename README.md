# Constellation

This repository contains my Constellation java program created by me.

The program creates and draws a constellation on a 1600 x 800 canvas window with the command-line input provided from a user. 

The user can specify the number stars they wish to have in their constellattion.

The x and y coordinates of each individual star. 

And the user can set a name that will be drawn on the canvas window along with constellation.

**Any stars displayed in the background behind the constellation are randomly generated and randomly sized to create galaxy-like appearance.
